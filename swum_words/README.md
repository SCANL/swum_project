# swum_words
## Name
Modeling Program Words with SWUM <sub>words</sub>
## Description
Using a word node in SWUM <sub>words</sub> in a specific code sample, we split each identifier using the NLTK python library and identifier splitting techniques. Then we annotate each word node with parts of speech tagging and its role in the code. The analysis of the word nodes are then sent to the SWUM <sub>phrases</sub> stage where word relationships are used to develop edges between word nodes.
